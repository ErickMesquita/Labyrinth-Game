# Labyrinth-Game
LABYRINTH is a 2d single-screen scroller game. Using AWSD keys, the player must help the blue dot escape from the procedurally generated maze, going from “START” to “FINISH”. At the end of each level, a speed bonus is awarded to the player, but also the generated mazes get bigger and bigger! Each time you play, a different maze will be generated.
