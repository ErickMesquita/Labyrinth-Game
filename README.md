LABYRINTH is a 2d single-screen scroller game. Using AWSD keys, the player must help the blue dot escape from the procedurally generated maze, going from “START” to “FINISH”. At the end of each level, a speed bonus is awarded to the player, but also the generated mazes get bigger and bigger! Each time you play, a different maze will be generated.

## Game Flow Outline
LABYRINTH is a Casual game designed to have really simple instructions, so anyone can learn to play in seconds. But things get tricky as levels go up! LABYRINTH demands logic to find the path when the random mazes are way larger than the screen.

## GAME EXPERIENCE
Start screen is a menu inspired on traditional videogames. Just use “UP” and “DOWN” arrow keys, or “W” and “S” keys to highlight the desired option, and press “Enter”.

The player, represented by the blue dot, will always remain in the center of the screen. In scroller games, the background gives the overall impression of movement. Level 1 is easy, mostly because it is possible to fit the entire maze in the screen.

As levels go by, the speed bonus gives the player the sensation they will beat the level faster. The maze increases a lot in size, so lots of forks will be found, demanding the player to make decisions.

There are infinite levels for you to try! Check it out
